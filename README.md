Morse Code Converter:

  This project is a simple Morse Code Converter that allows users to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. It is implemented in Python and is designed to be 
  interactive and user-friendly.

Features:

  Text to Morse Code Conversion: Converts any string input into its equivalent Morse code representation.
  Morse Code to Text Conversion: Decodes Morse code input back into plain text.
  Error Handling: Notifies the user about any unrecognized characters or Morse code symbols during conversion.
  Word and Character Separation: Supports proper handling of spaces for word separation.

Usage:

  Text to Morse Code Conversion:
    Run the script.
    Enter a string when prompted (e.g., Hello World!).
    The program outputs the corresponding Morse code (e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. --- .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--).
  Morse Code to Text Conversion:
    Run the script.
    Enter Morse code symbols separated by spaces for characters and three spaces for words (e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. --- .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--).
    The program decodes it back into plain text (e.g., HELLO WORLD!).
    
Limitations:

  Only supports English letters, digits, and a limited set of special characters.
  Unrecognized characters will produce a warning and a placeholder.

Future Enhancements:

  Support for batch conversion from files.
  GUI-based version for ease of use.
  Add support for more languages and symbols.
